# Note Taker

This application is a convenient way to store and manage things that you need to accomplish in your day. This application allows you to create new notes and add them into a list on the left side. They are sorted by the title for ease of access and when you click the title it shows the note details. Once you have completed the items on the note you can easily delete the note to prevent clutter.

This app is deployed on render. 

This was my first time deploying an app via render and it was challenging at first as my file organization was not optimal but now i see why it is so extremely important for organized files and folders!

Here is the URL to the application deployed on Render:
